description: Using solid phase extraction (SPE), samples of an environment pollutant
  in water were concentrated and transferred to a volatile solvent for a gas chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This method was optimized and deployed to determine
  the trace levels of environmental pollutant in various regions with commercial activity
  of resource gathering.
